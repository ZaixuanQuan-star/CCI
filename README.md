# CCI prediction
## Abstract
本研究旨在分析影响消费者信心指数的主要因素，并评估这些因素在预测 CCI 中的有效性。研究首先采用皮尔逊相关系数、Lasso 回归及递归特征消除法（RFE）对众多潜在影响因素进行筛选，确定关键特征。随后，利用线性回归模型、决策树模型及随机森林模型对选定特征进行训练与预测，以考察不同模型的预测性能。进一步地，通过决策树和随机森林模型的特征重要性评分，评估各变量对 CCI 的贡献程度。最后，基于重要特征，采用长短期记忆网络（LSTM）和多层感知器（MLP）等深度学习模型作为基准模型，综合分析这些因素在预测消费者信心指数中的表现。研究结果将为理解消费者信心的驱动因素及其预测提供实证依据。

This study aims to analyze the main factors influencing the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these factors in predicting CCI. Firstly, the Pearson correlation coefficient, Lasso regression, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used to screen numerous potential influencing factors and identify key features. Subsequently, linear regression, decision tree, and random forest models are utilized to train and predict with the selected features, so as to examine the prediction performance of different models. Furthermore, through the feature importance scores of the decision tree and random forest models, the contribution degree of each variable to CCI is evaluated. Finally, based on the important features, deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) are adopted as benchmark models to comprehensively analyze the performance of these factors in predicting the Consumer Confidence Index. The research results will provide an empirical basis for understanding the driving factors of consumer confidence and its prediction.
